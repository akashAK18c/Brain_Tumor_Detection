Topic: Detection and Classification ofTumors in Medical Images (X-rays and MRI s) Description:
The accurate and timely detection of tumors in medical images is critical for diagnosing and treating various medical conditions. This use case focuses on leveraging computer vision technology to detect and classify tumors in medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, aiding medical professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.
Key Functionalities:
Image Acquisition:
• Medical professionals acquire X-ray or MRI images from patients, focusing on the affected areas or organs suspected of having tumors.
2. Image Preprocessing:
• The system preprocesses the medical images to enhance their quality and reduce noise, ensuring optimal input for tumor detection.
3. Tumor Detection:
• Using advanced image processing and computer vision algorithms. the system identifies potential tumor regions within the medical images.
• It highlights regions of interest (ROIS) where tumors may be present.
4. Tumor Classification:
• The system classifies detected tumors into specific categories (e.g, benign or malignant) based on their visual characteristics.
		It may also provide information about tumor size, shape. and location.
5. Alert Generation:
• If a tumor is detected, the system generates real-time alerts for medical professionals, providing details about the tumor's location, classification, and any additional relevant information.
This use case demonstrates the potential of computer vision in revolutionizing medical imaging and diagnosis. By automating tumor detection and classification in X-rays and MRIs, it empowers healthcare professionals to make more accurate and timely decisions, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
